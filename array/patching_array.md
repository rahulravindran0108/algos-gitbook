## Patching Array

Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.

```
Example 1:
nums = [1, 3], n = 6
Return 1.
```

### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minPatches(self, nums, n):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        miss, added, i = 1, 0, 0
        while miss <= n:
            if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= miss:
                miss += nums[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                miss += miss
                added += 1
        return added
```
