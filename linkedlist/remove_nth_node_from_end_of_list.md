## Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,

   Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:
Given n will always be valid.
Try to do this in one pass.

### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type n: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        p1 = p2 = dummy
        
        for i in range(n):
            p1 = p1.next
        
        while p1.next:
            p1 = p1.next
            p2 = p2.next
        p2.next = p2.next.next
        
        return dummy.next
```
