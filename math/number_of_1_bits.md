## Number of 1 bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        c = 0
        while n > 0:
            c += n & 1
            n = n >> 1
        return c
```
