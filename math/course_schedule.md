## Course Schedule

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

For example:

`2, [[1,0]]`

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

`2, [[1,0],[0,1]]`

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canFinish(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        """
        :type numCourses: int
        :type prerequisites: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        graph = [[] for _ in xrange(numCourses)]
        visit = [0 for _ in xrange(numCourses)]
        for x,y in prerequisites:
            graph[x].append(y)
        def dfs(i):
            if visit[i] == -1:
                return False
            if visit[i] == 1:
                return True
            visit[i] = -1
            for j in graph[i]:
                if not dfs(j):
                    return False
            visit[i] = 1
            return True
        for i in xrange(numCourses):
            if not dfs(i):
                return False
        return True
```
