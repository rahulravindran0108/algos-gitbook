## Find Right Intervals

Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.

For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which means that the interval j has the minimum start point to build the "right" relationship for interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist, store -1 for the interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as an array.

### Solution

```python
# Definition for an interval.
# class Interval(object):
#     def __init__(self, s=0, e=0):
#         self.start = s
#         self.end = e

class Solution(object):
    def findRightInterval(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[Interval]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        l = sorted((e.start, i) for i, e in enumerate(intervals))
        res = []
        for e in intervals:
            r = bisect.bisect_left(l, (e.end,))
            res.append(l[r][1] if r < len(l) else -1)
        return res
```
