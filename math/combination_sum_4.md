## Combination Sum 4

Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

Example:
```
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
```

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.

### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def combinationSum4(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        nums, dp = sorted(nums), [1] + [0] * target
        for i in range(target + 1):
            for num in nums:
                if num > i: break
                if num == i: dp[i] += 1
                if num < i: dp[i] += dp[i-num]
        return dp[target]

```
