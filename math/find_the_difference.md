## Find the Difference

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

### Solution

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution(object):
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        result = defaultdict(int)
        for i in s:
            result[i] += 1

        for i in t:
            result[i] -= 1
            if result[i] < 0:
                return i
        return None
```
