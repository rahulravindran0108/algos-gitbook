## Climb Stairs

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        elif n == 2:
            return 2

        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 2
        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
        return dp[-1]
```
