## Edit Distance

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character

### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minDistance(self, word1, word2):
        """
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)
        dp = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(m+1)]
        for i in range(n+1):
            dp[0][i] = i
        for j in range(m+1):
            dp[j][0] = j
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            for j in range(1, n+1):
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])
        return dp[m][n]

```
